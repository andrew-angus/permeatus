  abstract = {The paper presents an overview of the main results of the European Commission Network of Excellence ``HySafe'' activity to estimate an allowable hydrogen permeation rate for automotive legal requirements and standards. A slow, long term hydrogen release such as that due to permeation from a vehicle into an inadequately ventilated enclosed structure is a potential risk associated with the use of hydrogen in automotive applications. Due to its small size hydrogen permeates through the containment materials found in compressed gaseous hydrogen storage systems and is an issue that requires consideration for containers with non-metallic (polymer) liners. Various rates have been proposed in draft legal requirements and standards based on different scenarios and the assumption that permeated hydrogen disperses homogeneously in a garage like enclosure. This paper focuses on the development of a methodology to estimate an allowable upper limit for hydrogen permeation in automotive applications, by investigating the behaviour of hydrogen when released through permeation with a focus on European scenarios. The background to the activity is explained, worst credible scenarios are identified, a methodology proposed and a maximum hydrogen permeation rate from road vehicles into enclosed structures is estimated.},

  abstract = {Synthetic polymers are versatile and widely used materials. Similar to small organic molecules, a large chemical space of such materials is hypothetically accessible. Computational property prediction and virtual screening can accelerate polymer design by prioritizing candidates expected to have favorable properties. However, in contrast to organic molecules, polymers are often not well-defined single structures but an ensemble of similar molecules, which poses unique challenges to traditional chemical representations and machine learning approaches. Here, we introduce a graph representation of molecular ensembles and an associated graph neural network architecture that is tailored to polymer property prediction. We demonstrate that this approach captures critical features of polymeric materials, like chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization, and achieves superior accuracy to off-the-shelf cheminformatics methodologies. While doing so, we built a dataset of simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for {$>$}40k polymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain architecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine learning approaches. The dataset and machine learning models presented in this work pave the path toward new classes of algorithms for polymer informatics and, more broadly, introduce a framework for the modeling of molecular ensembles.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting new polymers' properties with machine learning models apriori to synthesis has potential to significantly accelerate new polymers' discovery and development. However, accurately and efficiently capturing polymers' complex, periodic structures in machine learning models remains a grand challenge for the polymer cheminformatics community. Specifically, there has yet to be an ideal solution for the problems of how to capture the periodicity of polymers, as well as how to optimally develop polymer descriptors without requiring human-based feature design. In this work, we tackle these problems by utilizing a periodic polymer graph representation that accounts for polymers' periodicity and coupling it with a message-passing neural network that leverages the power of graph deep learning to automatically learn chemically relevant polymer descriptors. Remarkably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 10 distinct polymer property prediction tasks. These results highlight the advancement in predictive capability that is possible through learning descriptors that are specifically optimized for capturing the unique chemical structure of polymers.},

  abstract = {Lightweight pressure vessels of type IV for hydrogen storage consist of a thermoplastic inner liner, commonly from polyethylene or polyamide. The liner is the permeation barrier against the compressed gas and must prevent the formation of cracks, also after temperature changes, for example after refueling processes. In the present work high-density polyethylene, cross-linked polyethylene, polyamide 6 and polyamide 12 were characterized by tensile tests, single notch impact tests and permeations measurements before and after a cyclic thermal aging process. The aging only lead to slight changes of mechanical properties due to post-crystallization, but to a significant decrease of permeation properties. This decrease was contributed to weakened, amorphous regions where chain splitting occurred. Considerable differences in properties resulted from different peroxide cross-linking times of polyethylene at the same temperature. A longer holding time at 200 {\textdegree}C led to an improvement in impact strength by a factor of more than three. However, the permeation properties decreased by about 50 \%, indicating that peroxide cross-linking in the melt inhibited the formation of crystalline regions.},

First, ideal structural arrangements have proven to be a feasibly sound method for hydrogen storage. Second, an efficient methodology for examination of cellular polymers under internal pressure was developed.

A unified empirical model is proposed, which uses as variables ultimate fiber volume fraction in addition to fiber volume fraction.

This issue is exacerbated in the presence of nonlinear problems, where numerical iterations are generally needed. We propose a method that utilizes machine learning to generate a direct relationship between the element state and its forces, which avoids the complex task of finding the internal displacement field and eliminates the need for numerical iterations. To generate our model, we choose an existing finite element formulation, extract data from an instance of that element, and feed that data to the machine learning algorithm. The result is an approximated model of the element that can be used in the same context. Unlike most data-driven techniques applied to individual elements, our method is not tied to any particular machine learning algorithm, and it does not impose any restriction on the solver of choice. In addition, we guarantee that our elements are physically accurate by enforcing frame indifference and conservation of linear and angular momentum. Our results indicate that this can considerably reduce the error of the method and the computational cost of producing and solving the model.},

  abstract = {Long term moisture exposure has been shown to affect the mechanical performance of polymeric composite structures. This reduction in mechanical performance must be considered during product design in order to ensure long term structure survival. In order to determine the long-term moisture effects on composite components, representative parts are commonly tested after having been exposed to an accelerated moisture conditioning environment. Accelerated moisture conditions are established in order to rapidly drive moisture into test specimens simulating worst-case long term exposure scenarios. Currently accepted methodologies for analyzing the time required to condition specimens are limited, allowing only simple geometry and an assumption that diffusivity rates are independent of the flow path or direction. Therefore, a more advanced finite element method is desired. In the current work, a three-dimensional model is developed and implemented in commercial finite element code. The parametric study has been conducted for 3D shapes, moisture diffusion pathways, and varying moisture and temperature conditions. Finite element results are validated with a one-dimensional analytical model and experimental results. The moisture model developed for the homogeneous composite laminate is extended for hybrid composites. In the following study, the moisture diffusion characteristics in two-phase hybrid composites using moisture concentration-dependent diffusion method have been investigated. The two phases are unidirectional S-glass fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix and unidirectional graphite fiber-reinforced epoxy matrix. A user-defined subroutine was developed to implement this method into commercial finite element code. Three-dimensional finite element models were developed to investigate the moisture diffusion in hybrid composites. A normalization approach was also integrated in the model to remove the moisture concentration discontinuity at the interface of different material components. The moisture diffusion in the three-layer hybrid composite exposed to 45 {\textordmasculine}C/84\% relative humidity for 70 days was simulated and validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental findings.},

It is demonstrated that instead of using brute-force methods, machine learning is a much more efficient approach and can generate optimal designs with similar performance to those obtained from an exhaustive search. Furthermore, it is shown that the toughening and strengthening mechanism observed in composites at the continuum-scale by combining stiff and soft constituents is valid for nanomaterials as well.

With a longer length of oligo(tetrafluoroethene) segment, the 6FDA/12p has permeability and selectivity greater than 6FDA/8p. Hence, this study may provide a guideline for designing PAI membranes to have desirable properties of permeability and permselectivity.},

Experiments show that thermoplastic composites can reach low permeation rate as long as a damage-free microstructure is ensured.

It is further integrated with a cohesive zone model (CZM) based on a stiffness-separation law. The influence of hydrogen on the cohesive law has been implemented through a newly proposed approach rooted in the hydrogen enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism. Finally, this coupled model has been utilized to assess hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility of materials through the prediction of crack initiation time. The crack initiation time decreases with the increase of initial hydrogen concentration in a quench and tempered 36NiCrMo4 (4340) steel showing a ductile-brittle transition behavior. Similar observations were done from ISL experiments. In addition to initial hydrogen concentration, the influence of yield strength, fracture toughness and hydrogen diffusivity on material susceptibility was also studied. Three different materials-iron, niobium, 304 stainless steel in addition to 36NiCrMo4 (4340) steel were selected for the study. Iron shows better resistance to HE failure owing to its low yield strength and high fracture toughness while 304 austenitic stainless steel reveals least susceptibility to hydrogen induced cracking. This is largely attributed to the lower diffusivity of hydrogen in 304 stainless steel.},

The calculations show that high angle boundaries are more influential in controlling H diffusion in presence of low initial (bulk) H concentrations, while dislocations can have more pronounced impact, when the bulk H concentration is higher. A microstructural model comprising of prior austenite grains and packets was further developed. The study highlights the importance of packet boundaries (PBs) moderating H diffusion in martensite microstructure.

A model is developed for the effective diffusivity of polymer nanocomposites that takes into account clustering of nanoparticles induced by an increase in their content. An advantage of the model is that it (i) predicts both onestep and two-step experimental diagrams in an unified manner, and (ii) involves only two adjustable parameters with transparent physical meaning. The model is applied to the analysis of barrier properties of composites loaded with layered silicate clays, graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide, boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide. Good agreement is shown between the experimental data and results of simulation. The influence of polymer matrices, types and chemical modifications of nanoparticles and preparation conditions on aggregation of filler is studied numerically.},

In this work, we derive and compare three different homogenisation methods to obtain the effective permeation coefficients for hydrogen permeation through composite laminates: the Wiener bounds, the Hashin{\textendash}Shtrikman bounds and a numerical finite element calculation of a representative volume element (RVE). A comparison of the methods shows that the Hashin{\textendash}Shtrikman bounds give the most satisfactory results. As the leak-tightness of composite tanks is severely reduced by cracks, we further include the effect of inter-fibre cracks through a second homogenisation procedure. Through a combination of the upper and the lower Wiener bounds, it is possible to estimate the influence of the crack volume on the effective permeability. The results shows that matrix cracking should be avoided entirely to ensure the leak-tightness.},

However, due to the penetration of hydrogen, buckling of the plastic liner will happen. Therefore hydrogen permeation behavior in the liner polymer materials of Type IV hydrogen storage vessels is an important problem. In order to investigate the hydrogen permeation in the liner material of type IV hydrogen storage vessels, the polyethylene and polyamide models were constructed by the Materials Studio (MS) molecular simulation soft\- ware to simulate the diffusion and adsorption process of hydrogen molecules in polyethylene and polyamide under the temperature of 263{\textendash}353 K. The influence of solubility coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and Fractional Free Volume on the permeability of gas molecules were also analyzed. The permeation mechanism of hydrogen in polyethylene and polyamide materials was investigated at molecular scale. The results show under the same conditions, solubility coefficient, diffusion coefficient and permeability coefficient of hydrogen in polyethylene are greater than those in polyamide. Under the simulated conditions in the paper, compared with polyethylene, polyamide shows better hydrogen permeability resistance.},

High-pressure hydrogen gas permeability characteristics up to 100~MPa are measured for high-density polyethylene.

Incorporating softer constituents into brittle materials can alleviate stress concentration, leading to tougher and stronger composites. However, searching for the optimal designs of composites is extremely challenging due to the astronomical number of possible material and geometry combinations. Here, we apply machine learning to a composite system and demonstrate its capacity to accurately and efficiently predict mechanical properties including toughness and strength. The method we used incorporates machine learning techniques to generate optimal designs with orders of magnitude better than the mean properties of the input training data, and at a much lower computational cost compared to exhaustive methods. Additionally, the method can further rebuild the detailed performances of the designs, even when this information is lost in the training process. The results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to search for optimal designs with very limited training data. To demonstrate the application of machine learning to composite design, we optimize a large-scale system not tractable by an exhaustive brute force approach and show that it is a promising tool towards composite design. This work offers a new perspective in the exploration of design spaces and accelerating the discovery of new functional, customizable composites.},

  abstract = {Type 4 700-bar compressed hydrogen storage tanks were modeled using ABAQUS. The finite element model was first calibrated against data for 35-L subscale test tanks to obtain the composite translation efficiency, and then applied to full sized tanks. Two variations of the baseline T700/epoxy composite were considered in which the epoxy was replaced with a low cost vinyl ester resin and low cost resin with an alternate sizing. The results showed that the reduction in composite weight was attributed primarily to the lower density of the resin and higher fiber volume fraction in the composite due to increased squeeze-out with the lower viscosity vinyl ester resin. The system gravimetric and volumetric capacities for the onboard storage system that holds 5.6~kg H2 are 4.2~wt\% (1.40~kWh/kg) and 24.4~g-H2/L (0.81~kWh/L), respectively. The system capacities increase and carbon fiber requirement decreases if the in-tank amount of unrecoverable hydrogen is reduced by lowering the tank ``empty'' pressure. Models of an alternate tank design showed potential 4{\textendash}7\% saving in composite usage for tanks with a length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of 2.8{\textendash}3.0 but no saving for L/D of 1.7. A boss with smaller opening and longer flange does not appear to reduce the amount of helical windings.},

Lightweight vessels out of fibre composites are promising candidates. Their disadvantage might be gas permeation, especially when exposed to mechanical and thermal cycling. For several applications of superconducting magnets (pulsed magnets, SQUID detectors), non-metallic and non-magnetic cryostats are required. Fibre glass composites are promising candidate materials, but again a sufficient low helium gas permeation is required. The permeation of helium, hydrogen and methane gas has been investigated. The principal arrangement for measuring gas permeation through polymers, fibre glass and carbon reinforced epoxy resins will be shown.

The pressure-dependent gas transport behaviors of the four gases are presented and compared. Gas sorption follows Henry's law up to 9~MPa, while pressure-dependent diffusion behavior is not observed below 6~MPa. The magnitude of the diffusivity of the four gases decreases in the order DHe\,{$>$}\,DH2\,{$>$}\,DAr\,{$>$}\,DN2 in all polymers, closely related to the kinetic diameter of the gas molecules. The dependence of gas species on solubility is in contrast to that on diffusivity.

  abstract = {ConspectusConcentration-driven processes in solution, i.e., phenomena that are sustained by persistent concentration gradients, such as crystallization and surface adsorption, are fundamental chemical processes. Understanding such phenomena is crucial for countless applications, from pharmaceuticals to biotechnology. Molecular dynamics (MD), both in- and out-of-equilibrium, plays an essential role in the current understanding of concentration-driven processes. Computational costs, however, impose drastic limitations on the accessible scale of simulated systems, hampering the effective study of such phenomena. In particular, due to these size limitations, closed system MD of concentration-driven processes is affected by solution depletion/enrichment that unavoidably impacts the dynamics of the chemical phenomena under study. As a notable example, in simulations of crystallization from solution, the transfer of monomers between the liquid and crystal phases results in a gradual depletion/enrichment of solution concentration, altering the driving force for phase transition. In contrast, this effect is negligible in experiments, given the macroscopic size of the solution volume. Because of these limitations, accurate MD characterization of concentration-driven phenomena has proven to be a long-standing simulation challenge. While disparate equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulation strategies have been proposed to address the study of such processes, the methodologies are in continuous development.In this context, a novel simulation technique named constant chemical potential molecular dynamics (C{$\mu$}MD) was recently proposed. C{$\mu$}MD employs properly designed, concentration-dependent external forces that regulate the flux of solute species between selected subregions of the simulation volume. This enables simulations of systems under a constant chemical drive in an efficient and straightforward way. The C{$\mu$}MD scheme was originally applied to the case of crystal growth from solution and then extended to the simulation of various physicochemical processes, resulting in new variants of the method. This Account illustrates the C{$\mu$}MD method and the key advances enabled by it in the framework of in silico chemistry. We review results obtained in crystallization studies, where C{$\mu$}MD allows growth rate calculations and equilibrium shape predictions, and in adsorption studies, where adsorption thermodynamics on porous or solid surfaces was correctly characterized via C{$\mu$}MD. Furthermore, we will discuss the application of C{$\mu$}MD variants to simulate permeation through porous materials, solution separation, and nucleation upon fixed concentration gradients. While presenting the numerous applications of the method, we provide an original and comprehensive assessment of concentration-driven simulations using C{$\mu$}MD. To this end, we also shed light on the theoretical and technical foundations of C{$\mu$}MD, underlining the novelty and specificity of the method with respect to existing techniques while stressing its current limitations. Overall, the application of C{$\mu$}MD to a diverse range of fields provides new insight into many physicochemical processes, the in silico study of which has been hitherto limited by finite-size effects. In this context, C{$\mu$}MD stands out as a general-purpose method that promises to be an invaluable simulation tool for studying molecular-scale concentration-driven phenomena.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-fueled fuel cell vehicles offer an environmentally attractive technology alternative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions driven, in part, by the transportation sector. The use of hydrogen/fuel cell integrated systems could also benefit other mobile applications such as forklifts and yard tractor utility vehicles. This research aims at quantifying the risks associated with gaseous diffusion through the walls of on-board vessels containing hydride materials as hydrogen storage media. The storage vessels of interest to this study include Type-III (made of carbon fiber reinforced composite wrapping with an inner metallic liner) and Type-IV (same as Type-III but with a polymeric liner instead of the metallic liner). In Type-III vessels, the liner could be aluminum or stainless steel and in Type-IV, high density polyethylene (HDPE) is commonly used as the liner material. Two failure modes related to gaseous diffusion are considered in this research. The first failure mode represents diffusion of the contained hydrogen gas through the vessel walls to the environment. Hydrogen could also leak through the vessel's welds, end fittings such as O-rings or other seals. The severity of consequences of this potential failure mode varies depending on the degree of confinement in which the permeated hydrogen will gradually accumulate, hydrogen leak rate, liner thickness, liner temperature, vessel internal pressure and the proximity to an ignition source. The second failure mode represents potential diffusion of oxygen from the surrounding air to the contained hydride inside the vessel. Most of the hydride materials, such as NaAlH4, MgH2, LiBH4, and LiAlH4, are air reactive (pyrophoric) and the severity of consequences depends on the amount of permeated oxygen inside the vessel as well as the pyrophoricity of the hydride. The consequential failures that may result from this failure mode may include over-temperature, vessel over-pressurization, or loss of containment integrity. It is also possible that the diffused oxygen gas may react with the contained hydrogen gas to form water vapor which would exacerbate the severity of hydride reactions. Also in Type-III vessels, there is a chance that the diffused oxygen could react with the metal liner and form oxides. In this work, consequence analysis using experiments and modeling is utilized to evaluate risk associated with these oxygen diffusion scenarios. Detailed event tree models are presented for each gaseous diffusion failure mode as an accident initiating event. The frequency of occurrence of the generated risk sequences will be quantified. The safety insights to be drawn from this study should assist risk analysts, OEM, Codes and Standards development teams, and other stakeholders in making risk-informed decisions with respect to identifying the optimum type of liner material, liner wall thickness and other design components of the hydride storage vessels for on-board vehicle applications.},

  abstract = {The recent successes of the Materials Genome Initiative have opened up new opportunities for data-centric informatics approaches in several subfields of materials research, including in polymer science and engineering. Polymers, being inexpensive and possessing a broad range of tunable properties, are widespread in many technological applications. The vast chemical and morphological complexity of polymers though gives rise to challenges in the rational discovery of new materials for specific applications. The nascent field of polymer informatics seeks to provide tools and pathways for accelerated property prediction (and materials design) via surrogate machine learning models built on reliable past data. We have carefully accumulated a data set of organic polymers whose properties were obtained either computationally (bandgap, dielectric constant, refractive index, and atomization energy) or experimentally (glass transition temperature, solubility parameter, and density). A fingerprinting scheme that captures atomistic to morphological structural features was developed to numerically represent the polymers. Machine learning models were then trained by mapping the fingerprints (or features) to properties. Once developed, these models can rapidly predict properties of new polymers (within the same chemical class as the parent data set) and can also provide uncertainties underlying the predictions. Since different properties depend on different length-scale features, the prediction models were built on an optimized set of features for each individual property. Furthermore, these models are incorporated in a user-friendly online platform named Polymer Genome (www.polymergenome.org). Systematic and progressive expansion of both chemical and property spaces are planned to extend the applicability of Polymer Genome to a wide range of technological domains.},

  abstract = {In France, the steel transportation network for natural gas is connected to the distribution network which operates at lower pressure. This one (total length of 165 000 km) is mainly made of polymer pipes like polyethylene. With the introduction of hydrogen in mixture with natural gas and finally the transport of pure hydrogen, the key challenge is the high level of permeability that is to say the flow rate of hydrogen through polymer infrastructures (pipes or components like connecting parts). This high flow rate of hydrogen has to be taken into account for safety and economic requirements. Long-term behaviour must be carefully assessed: permeation/diffusion properties, thermo-mechanical behaviour and ageing. It is important to characterize the existing distribution network and to propose more innovative materials than polyethylene that could meet the targets for future hydrogen distribution applications. The aim of this project was to develop and assess material solutions to cope with today problems in term of high flow rate of hydrogen and ageing under a hydrogen environment. Polyethylene is considered as a reference material since it is used today in natural gas distribution pipes. Test benches and protocols for testing materials in term of mechanical and barrier properties were first developed. On the other hand, technical polymers (multi-layers, other thermoplastics, polymer blends) have been proposed and studied to improve gas-barrier performances compared to polyethylene. Step by step, permeation and basic mechanical tests have been performed and then more specific characterisations have been done (for long-term ageing under various conditions) in order to choose one or several materials that could meet the specifications required by hydrogen distribution. The design of a pipe prototype was also carried out at the end the project and an economic study was performed for the different potential solutions.},

  abstract = {The use of hydrogen as a fuel is increasing exponentially, and the most economical way to store and transport hydrogen for fuel use is as a high-pressure gas. Polymers are widely used for hydrogen distribution and storage systems because they are chemically inert towards hydrogen. However, when exposed to high-pressure hydrogen, some hydrogen diffuses through polymers and occupies the preexisting cavities inside the material. Upon depressurization, the hydrogen trapped inside polymer cavities can cause blistering or cracking by expanding these cavities. A continuum mechanics{\textendash}based deformation model was deployed to predict the stress distribution and damage propagation while the polymer undergoes depressurization after high-pressure hydrogen exposure. The effects of cavity size, cavity location, and pressure inside the cavity on damage initiation and evolution inside the polymer were studied. The stress and damage evolution in the presence of multiple cavities was also studied, because interaction among cavities alters the damage and stress field. It was found that all these factors significantly change the stress state in the polymer, resulting in different paths for damage propagation. The effect of adding carbon black filler particles and plasticizer on the damage was also studied. It was found that damage tolerance of the polymer increases drastically with the addition of carbon black fillers, but decreases with the addition of the plasticizer.},

  abstract = {Polymer materials are used widely as sealing materials and liners in hydrogen storage and transportation infrastructure. During operating conditions, polymers are exposed to high pressure hydrogen gas periodically. When in contact, the hydrogen gas diffuses through the polymer material with ease due to its smaller sized molecules compared to the polymer molecules. In the event of rapid decompression of outside hydrogen gas, the hydrogen molecules within the polymer diffuse out. This process is known as the desorption of polymer and can cause blisters or cracking causing permanent damage to the polymer. Here, we used a combined experimental and modeling approach to investigate the desorption of the hydrogen gas in the polymer. Thermal desorption analysis (TDA) experiments were performed on the polymer sample exposed to the high-pressure hydrogen gas to measure the diffusion coefficient and equilibrium hydrogen concentration. Experiments also provided the quantity of hydrogen within the polymer during the desorption process which followed Fick's law. However, for higher pressurization values, some anomaly was observed in the quantity of hydrogen remaining in the polymer sample. A continuum mechanics based coupled diffusion{\textendash}deformation-damage model was deployed to simulate the gas desorption process in the material using the finite element method to understand its effect on the material. It was found that the anomaly in TDA results were due to the blister formation on the polymer surface which resulted in longer hydrogen retention. Simulations also showed that blister formation can be affected by multiple parameters such as the addition of filler particles, and pre-existing cavity size.},

GFRP wrappings with different stacking thickness and fiber orientations are investigated in the numerical design. Finite element analyses are validated based on available analytical solution of orthotropic cylinders under internal pressure and are used to predict the internal pressure capacity of the RTPs. Overall, from the parametric study, it is understood that (i) the pressure is mainly carried by the reinforcement layers and marginally by the inner HDPE, and (ii) GFRP with 45{\textdegree} orientation works more efficiently than those with 0/90{\textdegree}. At higher internal pressures, either the thickness of glass fiber should increase, or the fiber orientation should be changed from 0/90{\textdegree} to 45{\textdegree} to maintain the stress on glass fiber layers within allowable utilization ratios (UR). Assuming a consequence factor of 1.3 (UR of 77\%) needs to be maintained, in a RTP with a DN80 HDPE inner pipe and at 45{\textdegree} orientation, GFRP with thickness of 1.1 mm is adequate to carry up to 8 MPa internal pressure. If a 90{\textdegree} orientation is used, the RTP can take up to 6 MPa with the same UR. The parametric study proposes required minimum thickness for RTPs of different fiber orientations and at internal pressures. This study prepares a design for future experimental studies as well as investigation into performance of RTPs under combined loadings.},

  abstract = {A prediction technique for gas permeability from polymer structure has been developed on the basis of a specific free volume diffusion theory. In this theory, the free volume available per unit mass in a polymer structure controls the rate of gas diffusion and, hence, its rate of permeation. The smaller this specific free volume is, the more difficult the gas diffusion and, thus, the better its barrier to gases becomes. Specifically, the theory predicts a linear relationship between log (permeability) and (-1/specific volume). A number of existing polymers covering six orders of magnitude in CO2 permeability and O2 permeability were found to follow this correlation. The specific free volume in a polymer was obtained from group contribution calculations. As a result, the gas permeabilities become predictable from the specific volume in a polymer which, in turn, varies with its molecular structure. The advent of this specific free volume theory for gas permeation simplifies greatly the selection of barrier materials for packaging applications. For a given barrier application, a critical specific free volume is first defined from its gas barrier requirement. The polymer structures having specific free volumes smaller than the critical value are then identified. These are the polymers that would have the necessary barrier performance. By this theory, molecular structures, with string polar-to-polar interactions and hydrogen-bonding forces are found to be good barriers to CO2 and O2.},

The ageing performance of the thermoplastic liner may affect hydrogen permeability and the consequent storage capacity, degrade the mechanical properties, and even increase the leakage risks of type IV tanks. In this paper, both testing procedures and evaluation parameters of an ageing test in a hydrogen environment required in several standards are compared and analyzed. Hydrogen static exposure in a high-temperature condition with a constant temperature and pressure is suggested to be a reasonable way to accelerate the ageing reaction of thermoplastic materials. A total of 192 h is considered a superior ageing test duration to balance the test economy and safety. The ageing test temperature in the high-temperature condition is suggested as no lower than 85 {\textdegree}C, while the upper limit of test pressure is suggested to be 1.25 NWP. In addition, the hydrogen permeation coefficient and mechanical properties are recognized as important parameters in ageing performance evaluation. Considering the actual service conditions, the influence of temperature/pressure cycling, depressurization rate, and humidity on the ageing performance of thermoplastics in hydrogen are advised to be investigated experimentally.},

  abstract = {We investigate the gas transport enhancement through nanotubes, relative to the prediction by the prevailing century-old Knudsen diffusion model. This enhancement is usually attributed to the partly specular molecular reflections at the smooth nanotube surface, which break the model assumption of completely diffusive reflections. However, an oversighted cause of the discrepancy between the measurement and theory that we found is that even for the gas transport with completely diffusive reflections, the Knudsen diffusion model based on Fick's first law is accurate only for long nanotubes. Additionally, for smooth nanotubes with partly specular reflections, the Knudsen diffusion model is also invalid even if the diffusion coefficient is corrected to account for the atomic-scale surface smoothness. On the other hand, the Knudsen diffusion model might be used for interpretations instead of predictions, and then the diffusion coefficient inferred from the measured mass flow rate could be completely different from the actual value. All those discrepancies and confusions stem from the implementation of Fick's first law can be avoided by using the molecular transmission probability obtained by the kinetic theory to quantify the flow rate of the Knudsen diffusion process. This work provides the correction to the Knudsen diffusion model for accurate predictions of gas diffusion through nanotubes and better interpretations of experimental measurements.},

This study for the first time develops a machine learning-assisted model, which aims at predicting the transverse mechanical properties of unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with microvoids. To this end, the stochastic microstructures are generated by random sequential expansion (RSE) and hard-core model. And the transverse elastic modulus, transverse tensile strength and transverse compressive strength are computed by micromechanics-based finite element (FE) method. Then, the reduced order representation of microstructures is determined using 2-point spatial correlations and principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized back propagation (BP) neural network is implemented to capture the potential nonlinear relationship between microstructure and transverse mechanical properties. The presented data-driven techniques can reproduce the FE simulation results with an R-value of 0.89 or greater. The excellent agreement between the predicted results and test datasets verifies the successful application of data science methodologies in elucidating the microstructure-property linkages of UD-CFRP composites with microvoids, and thus provides a promising tool for accelerating the smart design and optimization of composites.},

However, the extreme pressure reached in these storage systems accelerates the embrittlement of stainless steel caused by hydrogen, thus reducing its lifetime and seriously limiting the development of the hydrogen industry. Adding hydrogen permeation barrier coatings to the surface of stainless steel is one of the most effective approaches to delay or prevent the permeation of hydrogen and its isotopes through the substrate. Despite the relevance of the issue, studies on hydrogen permeation barrier coating materials have not so far been as popular as those on hydrogen storage materials. In this review, the mechanism of hydrogen permeation and the working principle of hydrogen barriers were investigated. On the basis of this, the hydrogen barring coatings were classified, the influence factors and defects of the coatings were analyzed, and the preparation technologies along with the methods of evaluation were summarized. Polymer composites strengthened by graphene and other materials were considered more competitive due to their cost effectiveness, better compactivity, and potential for mass production. This review may supply guidance to the further development of hydrogen permeation barring coating materials.},

  abstract = {Reinforced thermoplastic composite pipes (RTPs) have been widely used for oil and gas gathering and transportation. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has the greatest potential as a thermoplastic liner of RTPs due to its excellent thermal and mechanical properties. However, permeation of gases is inevitable in the thermoplastic liner, which may lead to blister failure of the liner and damage the safe operation of the RTPs. In order to clarify the permeation behavior and obtain the permeation mechanism of the mixture gas (CH4/CO2/H2S) in PVDF at the normal service conditions, molecular simulations were carried out by combining the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method and the Molecular Dynamics (MD) method. The simulated results showed that the solubility coefficients of gases increased with the decrease in temperature and the increase in pressure. The adsorption isotherms of all gases were consistent with the Langmuir model. The order of the adsorption concentration for different gases was H2S {$>$} CO2{$>$} CH4. The isosteric heats of gases at all the actual service conditions were much less than 42 kJ/mol, which indicated that the adsorption for all the gases belonged to the physical adsorption. Both of the diffusion and permeation coefficients increased with the increase in temperature and pressure. The diffusion belonged to Einstein diffusion and the diffusion coefficients of each gas followed the order of CH4 {$>$} CO2 {$>$} H2S. During the permeation process, the adsorption of gas molecules in PVDF exhibited selective aggregation, and most of them were adsorbed in the low potential energy region of PVDF cell. The mixed-gas molecules vibrated within the hole of PVDF at relatively low temperature and pressure. As the temperature and pressure increase, the gas molecules jumped into the neighboring holes occasionally and then dwelled in the holes, moving around their equilibrium positions.},

  abstract = {Type IV hydrogen storage cylinders comprise a polymer liner and offer advantages such as lightweight construction, high hydrogen storage density, and good fatigue performance. However, they are also characterized by higher hydrogen permeability. Consequently, it is crucial for the polymer liner material to exhibit excellent resistance to hydrogen permeation. International organizations have established relevant standards mandating hydrogen permeation tests for the liner material of type IV on-board hydrogen storage cylinders. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing research on hydrogen permeability and the hydrogen permeation test methods for the polymer liner material of type IV on-board hydrogen storage cylinders. By delving into the hydrogen permeation mechanism, a better understanding can be gained, offering valuable references for subsequent researchers in this field. This paper starts by thoroughly discussing the hydrogen permeation mechanism of the liner material. It then proceeds to compare and analyze the hydrogen permeation test methods specified by various standards. These comparisons encompass sample preparation, sample pretreatment, test device, test temperature and pressure, and qualification indicators. Then, this study offers recommendations aimed at enhancing the hydrogen permeation test method for the liner material. Additionally, the influence of test temperature, test pressure, and polymer material properties on the hydrogen permeability of the liner material is discussed. Finally, the influences of the test temperature, test pressure, and polymer material properties on the hydrogen permeability of the liner material are discussed.

Here, polyethylene/graphene flakes (PE/GFs) composite films with ultra-high gas barrier properties were produced by no-boundary constraints hot-pressing method. Theoretical analysis showed that an extensional-shear coupled flow was generated inside the polymer melts and the shear-flow force near the polymer melts surface is always higher than that inside the melts during this process, which is responsible for the alignment of GFs and PE molecules. The DSC results indicated that the crystallinity of the composites after hot-pressing is increased by about 10\%. The quantitative results of positron annihilation lifetime spectrum (PALS) showed that the fractional free volume of composites is reduced from 6.52 vol\% to 5.43 vol\%. As a consequence of the synergistic effect of the above aspects, the barrier performance of the composites has been significantly improved, and the helium leak rate of the composites reached an astonishing 3.92~{\texttimes}~10-9 Pa{\textbullet}m3/s with only 0.5 wt\% GFs, outperforming unoriented pure PE with a decrease of 98.6\%.

The packings occasionally contain monovacancies and trapped but unjammed ``rattler'' disks. The latter appear to be confined to the grain boundaries. The linear shear fractures preserve bond orientational order, but disrupt translational order, within the crystalline grains.

  abstract = {To reduce loss of hydrogen in storage vessels with high energy-to-weight-ratio, new materials, especially polymers, have to be developed as barrier materials. Very established methods for characterization of barrier materials with permeation measurements are the time-lag and flow rate method along with the differential pressure method, which resembles the nature of hydrogen vessel systems very well. Long measurement durations are necessary to gain suitable measurement data for these evaluation methods, and often restrictive conditions have to be fullfilled. For these reasons, common models for hydrogen permeation through single-layer and multi-layer membranes, as well as models for hydrogen gas properties were collected and reviewed. Using current computer power together with these models can reduce measurement time for characterization of the barrier properties of materials, while additional information about the quality of the measurement results is obtained.},

The results show that the prediction model can predict the effective thermal conductivity of ellipsoidal inclusion-reinforced composites with high accuracy ({$<$}10~\%).

When the ellipsoid particles are non-randomly distributed in the same directions in the matrix, the effective thermal conductivity of the composites depends on the angle between the heat flux direction and the long axis of the ellipsoid.},

  abstract = {Polymeric materials have played a significant role in the adoption of a multi-materials approach towards the development of a safe and cost-effective solution for hydrogen fuel storage in Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs). Numerous studies exist with regards to the exposure of polymeric materials to gaseous hydrogen as applicable to the hydrogen infrastructure and related compression, storage, delivery, and dispensing operations of hydrogen at fueling stations. However, the behavior of these soft materials under high pressure hydrogen environments has not been well understood. This study involves exposure of select thermoplastic and elastomeric polymers to high pressure hydrogen (70{\textendash}100 MPa) under static, isothermal, and isobaric conditions followed by characterization of physical properties and mechanical performance. Special attempt has been made to explain hydrogen effects on polymer properties in terms of polymer structure-property relationships, and also understand the influential role played by additives such as fillers, plasticizers, and processing aids in polymers exposed to hydrogen. Efforts have also been focused on deriving suitable conditions of static testing in high pressure hydrogen environments as a valuable part of developing a suitable test methodology for such systems. Understanding the relationships between polymer composition and microstructure, time of exposure, rate of depressurization, purge and exposure conditions, etc. in this simple study will help better define the test parameters for upcoming high pressure cycling experiments in hydrogen.},

  abstract = {We investigate permeation in non-ideal mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) having interfacial defects based on a multiscale simulation approach, involving sequential nanoscale and macroscale simulations. Our approach combines insight from equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulation of the transport in the individual phases, and in the interfacial region, with macroscopic simulation of the transport through solution of coupled 3-D partial differential equations (PDEs) via a finite-element method (FEM). Thus, unlike existing adaptations of classical effective medium theory (EMT), our approach avoids the empirical fitting of filler-polymer interfacial properties, such as interfacial thickness and permeability, against experimental permeation data. While the proposed multiscale simulation approach is general and applicable to any MMM system, it is illustrated in the context of single CO2 and CH4 permeation in two different polyimide-based MMMs; with one using MFI-type zeolite as filler phase and the other using carbon molecular sieves (CMS). For both systems, our nanoscale simulations reveal an interfacial region with rigidification of the polymer and reduced permeability at the polymer-adsorbent interface. Comparison of permeability predictions of classical EMT-based models considering interfacial rigidification, with our macroscale simulations, demonstrates the former to be best at low particle loadings. Further, our macroscale simulations reveal the existence of an optimum filler particle size, never discussed before, which maximizes the permeability in non-ideal MMMs; this arises from the competing effects of decrease in permeability and decrease of the relative interfacial resistance with increase of filler particle size. Moreover, the CO2/CH4 perm-selectivity is found strongly sensitive to the interfacial resistance for both finite uniform and non-uniform particle size distributions, an effect not captured by existing EMT models and overlooked in prior fundamental approaches.},

For polymers, the logarithm of the permeability coefficient is linear in the pressure for each gas, with negative slope for slightly soluble gases (He, Ne, H2, N2, O2, and Ar) and positive slope for highly soluble gases (CH4, Kr, CO2, and N2O). Analyzing these slopes by the method proposed permits contributions of hydrostatic pressure and concentration to the pressure dependence of permeation to be evaluated.

  abstract = {An effective permeation reduction of gaseous hydrogen isotopes into a metal wall by introducing a barrier is essential in two main fields: prevention of hydrogen-embrittlement in steels and control of the tritium inventory in future nuclear fusion reactors. By far the most important advances and relevant studies originate from the Nuclear Fusion Community where tritium retention is an important issue, influencing safety issues. Stable permeation barriers are searched among materials with the lowest bulk hydrogen solubility and diffusivity. Besides a few specific pure metals, like beryllium and tungsten, dense oxides, nitrides and carbides have been mostly investigated. Coating techniques for preparation of well adhered and perfect barriers are evidently of the same importance as the material selection itself. Most attractive are the techniques where an ad-layer is formed simply by oxidation. Other methods require specific gas environments with strong electric and magnetic fields, which may represent a limit for the ad-layers uniform coverage over large and uneven areas. Evaluation of the achieved barrier performances is another challenging task. Several new methods, which can trace hydrogen isotopes in bulk at very low concentrations, often miss in the determination of their mobility. Also, they do not reveal the role of barrier defects. The classical gas permeation rate method through coated membranes is still the most reliable option to determine the actual Hydrogen Permeation Barrier (HPB) efficiency. At elevated temperature, the hydrogen permeation rate is recorded at the downstream side of a coated membrane exposed to a substantially higher hydrogen upstream pressure. By using modern vacuum instrumentation techniques, even the most effective barriers can be well characterised.},

However, despite years of extensive research around the world, a complete and validated methodology for predicting the behaviour of composite structures including the effects of damage has not yet been fully achieved. The Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) is leading a currently running collaborative project to develop a methodology for determining mechanical behaviour and failure in composite structures. Key drivers of the project are the use of multi-axial testing machines for material characterisation and an appreciation of the issues involved due to the different length scales of any analysis. As part of the project, a critical review was performed to assess the state of the art in material constitutive modelling and composite failure theories. This paper summarises the results of the review, which includes a discussion of the various theories and approaches within the context of the dissipated energy density framework. The results of the review will be applied within the project to select appropriate constitutive modelling and failure approaches for implementation within a data-driven material characterisation methodology.},

The principles of the method rely on a two-scale computational homogenization approach which is applied successfully for the stress analysis of multi-phase solids under purely mechanical loading. The present paper extends this methodology to heat conduction problems. The flexibility of the method permits one to take into account local microstructural heterogeneities and thermal anisotropy, including non-linearities which might arise at some stage of the thermal loading history. The resulting complex microstructural response is transferred back to the macro level in a consistent manner. A proper macro to micro transition is established in terms of the applied boundary conditions and likewise a micro to macro transition is formulated in the form of consistent averaging relations. Imposition of boundary conditions and extraction of macroscopic quantities are elaborated in detail. A nested finite element solution procedure is outlined, and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by some illustrative example problems.

GCN-based models provide reliable prediction performances for the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), density ({$\rho$}), and elastic modulus (E) with substantial dependence on the dataset, which is the best for Tg (R2 {$\sim$} 0.9) and worst for E (R2 {$\sim$} 0.5). It is found that the GCN representations for polymers provide prediction performances of their properties comparable to the popular extended-connectivity circular fingerprint (ECFP) representation. Notably, the GCN combined with the neural network regression (GCN-NN) slightly outperforms the ECFP. It is investigated how the GCN captures important structural features of polymers to learn their properties. Using the dimensionality reduction, we demonstrate that the polymers are organized in the principal subspace of the GCN representation spaces with respect to the backbone rigidity. The organization in the representation space adaptively changes with the training and through the NN layers, which might facilitate a subsequent prediction of target properties based on the relationships between the structure and the property. The GCN models are found to provide an advantage to automatically extract a backbone rigidity, strongly correlated with Tg, as well as a potential transferability to predict other properties associated with a backbone rigidity. Our results indicate both the capability and limitations of the GCN in learning to describe polymer systems depending on the property.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel finite-element based method for finite-strain mechanochemistry with moving reaction fronts, which separate the chemically transformed and the untransformed phases, is proposed. The reaction front cuts through the finite elements and moves independently of the finite-element mesh, thereby removing the necessity for remeshing. The proposed method solves the coupled mechanics-diffusion{\textendash}reaction problem. In the mechanical part of the problem, the force equilibrium and the displacement continuity conditions at the reaction front are enforced weakly using a Nitsche-like method. The formulation is applicable to the case of large deformations and arbitrary constitutive behaviour, and is also consistent with the minimisation of the total potential energy.},

  abstract = {There is a wide range of industrially-relevant problems where mechanical stresses directly affect kinetics of chemical reactions. For example, this includes formation of oxide layers on parts of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and lithiation of Si in Li-ion batteries. Detailed understanding of these processes requires thermodynamically-consistent theories describing the coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical behaviour of those systems. Furthermore, as the majority of materials used in those systems have complex microstructures, multiscale modelling techniques are required for efficient simulation of their behaviour. Hence, the purpose of the present paper is two-fold: (1) to derive a thermodynamically-consistent thermo-chemo-mechanical theory; and (2) to propose a two-scale modelling approach based on the concept of computational homogenisation for the considered theory. The theory and the two-scale computational approach are implemented and tested using a number of computational examples, including the case of the reaction locking due to mechanical stresses.},

  abstract = {The permeation parameters of hydrogen gas in high density polyethylene (HDPE) system are sought by comparison with a diffusion model. The method of Green's functions is used to obtain solutions for the diffusion model. Permeation parameters are found from transient experimented data during two processes; pressurization followed by depressurization. The mechanical compression of HDPE during the pressurization process resulted in lower diffusivity coefficient values and higher solubility values. The results show that the diffusivity coefficient value in the pressurization process is 37\% of that during the depressurization process. At the start of the depressurization process, a short-duration fast flow rate of the hydrogen gas that is observed experimentally is explained by the addition of a contact conductance to the diffusion model. Study of the behavior of a pre-existing flaw under depressurization process of the HDPE and hydrogen gas system is included. Under quasi-static assumption, a prediction of internal pressure inside the flaw caused by diffusion using a constant volume model and a varying volume model is given. The results from these models are verified by FEM software COMSOL with a good agreement. Determination guild line of the safety of an HDPE with a pre-existing flaw with various sizes from failure by yielding, and the critical energy release rate Gc, and the critical stress intensity factor KIc is provided. The flaw with radius of 4 micron, 20 micron, 40 micron, 80 micron, and 100 micron located at various positions inside the Sample is used in the simulation. The results of calculation show that the Sample embedded with spherical flaw is safe from yielding. However, the Sample embedded with circular shaped flaw is fail to crack propagation when the flaw has radius greater than and equal to 20 micron while the flaw with radius of 4 micron is safe from failure. The maximum internal pressure depends on the location of the flaw in the HDPE. The time to reach the maximum internal pressure depends on the size of the flaw. Study of 1D model and 2D model during pressurization process in COMSOL shows relative percentage difference of the diffusive flux magnitude of 16.23 percent.},

  abstract = {Permeation is a combination of diffusion and sorption phenomena. The extent of permeation (gas/vapor/liquid) through a composite polymer material is a function of several factors including the composition of the polymer, the nature, distribution, and spatial orientation of the different phases in the micro-structure of the matrix polymer and those of the fillers, etc. Typically, computational techniques such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Widom insertion are used to model the diffusion and sorption aspects of permeation respectively. However, there is a necessity to employ semi-empirical modeling to either benchmark or validate the computational results. Semi-empirical modeling, thus, offers a powerful pathway into predicting properties of composite polymers. The models themselves can be developed based on several separate but uniquely effective principles. In this review, several such categories of semi-empirical models are listed and the principles behind their development are discussed. An attempt has been made to study their corresponding effectiveness for modeling permeation in a wide range of multi-phase polymeric systems. Additionally, certain empirical models are also listed with the semi-empirical models in order to compare their respective efficacies when it comes to predicting permeant transport and related phenomena.},

  abstract = {Carbon fiber is the most common reinforcing phase in composite materials. However, it is difficult to obtain the performance parameters of the monofilament. In this study, the relationship between the property variables of the carbon fiber monofilament and the macroscopic parameters of the composites is established using a regression tree, a type of decision tree model, in machine learning. First, in order to obtain the data for machine learning, representative volume element (RVE) models of single-layer and multi-layer carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) are established by a cross-scale finite element method (FEM), and periodic boundary conditions are loaded. Then, a correlation model between the carbon fiber properties and CFRP and matrix properties is established. The non-GUI mode is called by Software Isight to generate the sample data. Second, in order to avoid overfitting, the L1 norm method is used for feature selection before model training. Finally, the four elastic properties of the carbon fiber are analyzed by a regression tree model. After a series of parameter adjustments and model selection, the model with a better generalization performance was obtained. The validity of the models was verified by the validating sample set.},

PolymerGNN provides accurate estimates for polymer properties based on a database of complex and heterogeneous polyesters (linear/branched, homopolymers/copolymers) with experimentally refined properties. In PolymerGNN, each polyester is represented as a set of monomer units, which are introduced as molecular graphs. A virtual screening of a large, computationally generated database with materials of variable composition was performed, a task that demonstrates the applicability of the PolymerGNN on future studies that target the exploration of the polymer space.

  abstract = {The normal and the anomalous diffusion in binary polymer solutions are considered. After a survey of the theory of diffusion it is demonstrated which criteria must be fulfilled so that the Fickian diffusion occurs. For transport between the solvent and a solution, or between two solutions, normal diffusion is found. Experimental results with polystyrene + solvent systems are given. With good solvents the diffusion coefficient increases strongly with increasing polymer concentration, passes through a maximum at medium concentrations and decreases by several decades at high polymer concentrations. This concentration dependence arises because the diffusion coefficient is not only a transport coefficient, but also contains a thermodynamic factor. With poor solvents, which show a phase separation of the polymer at low temperatures, the concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient is even more complicated. With increasing concentration of polymer the diffusion coefficient first decreases, passes through a minimum and the increases again. In this case there is also a maximum at medium concentrations and a strong decrease at high polymer concentrations. The minimum for a binary system is located at the critical point of the system.Normally ln D is a linear function of 1/T. Deviations from the linear course can be explained by the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic factor.For anomalous diffusion the √t-relations are no longer valid, since the diffusion coefficient depends not only on concentration, but also explicitly on time. The anomalous diffusion is due to the fact that superimposed on the normal diffusion is another process. If a solvent penetrates into a glassy polymer, then relaxation processes are superimposed on the diffusion process. The polymer changes from the glassy state into a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Experimentally the continuous range between the pure glassy polymer and the pure solvent can be divided into three parts of an open system. In the first and the third part only diffusion occurs, while in the second part diffusion and structural relaxation are superimposed.},

  abstract = {Effective thermal conductivity is an important property of composites for different thermal management ap\- plications. Although physics-based methods, such as effective medium theory and solving partial differential equations, are widely applied to extract effective thermal conductivity, recently there is increasing interest to establish the structure-property linkage through machine learning methods. The prediction accuracy of con\- ventional machine learning methods highly depends on the features (descriptors) selected to represent the mi\- crostructures. In comparison, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can directly extract geometric features of composites, which have been demonstrated to establish structure-property linkages with high accuracy. How\- ever, to obtain the 3D microstructure in the composite is challenging in reality. In this work, we use 2D crosssection images and 2D CNNs to predict effective thermal conductivity of 3D composites, since 2D pictures can be much easier to obtain in real applications. The results show that by using multiple cross-section images along or perpendicular to the preferred directionality of the fillers, 2D CNNs can provide quite accurate prediction. Such a result is demonstrated with isotropic particle filled composites and anisotropic stochastic complex composites. In addition, we also discuss how to select representative cross-section images. It is found that the average over multiple images and the use of large-size images can reduce the uncertainty and increase the prediction accuracy. Besides, since cross-section images along the heat flow direction can distinguish between serial structures and parallel structures, they are more representative than cross-section images perpendicular to the heat flow direction.},

The theoretical models that have been proposed and developed in the literature, describe the transport mechanism of molecular species in polymers by diffusion involving a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient. However, the exact form of this dependency and exact information on the diffusion coefficient and on the solubility coefficient are not always available in the literature, in particular in extreme conditions like in the case of protective polymer coatings for flexible offshore pipes where the temperature and pressure of the diffusing gas can be very high. Using experimental data from permeation experiments on particularly developed experimental devices at the Institut Fran{\c c}ais du P{\'e}trole (IFP) we are able to study this dependency and have produced a method which allows to identify the parameters in the model from this data. Mathematically, this leads to a nonlinear least-squares optimisation problem with constraints in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs), which we will concentrate on in this paper. In particular, we will focus on the statistical analysis of the results and give confidence intervals for the estimated parameters. We will also present tests to check whether the assumptions on our model are appropriate and to identify whether the introduction of a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is necessary for particular pairs of gas and polymer and at certain temperatures and pressures. We will demonstrate the performance of our method and the statistical analysis of the results on some data obtained with the experimental devices at the IFP.},

In the method, a thermoplastic liner specimen is cycled between the maximum and minimum expected working temperatures while it is differentially pressurized with high-pressure hydrogen gas. The number of thermal cycling intervals corresponds to those expected within the tank s design lifetime. At prescribed intervals, hydrogen permeation measurements are done in situ to assess the ability of the liner specimen to maintain its hydrogen barrier properties and to model its permeability over the tank lifetime. Finally, the model is used to assess whether the steady-state leakage rate in the tank could potentially exceed the leakage specification for hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles. A durability assessment was performed on a specimen of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) that is in current use as a tank liner. Hydrogen permeation measurements were performed on several additional tank liner polymers as well as novel polymers proposed for use as storage tank liners and hydrogen barrier materials. The following technical barriers from the Fuel Cell Technologies Program MYRDD were addressed by the project: D. Durability of on-board storage systems lifetime of at least 1500 cycles G.

Within the service conditions (233{\textendash}358 K, 0{\textendash}87.5 MPa) of the Type-IV tanks, the dissolution and diffusion behaviors of H2 in polyamide 6 are comprehensively explored for the first time through the molecular dynamics and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations in this study. The diffusion mechanism of H2 in polyamide 6 is further revealed. The results show that both the diffusion and permeability coefficients have positive correlations with temperature, whereas the opposite is true for the solubility coefficient. These re\- lationships are all consistent with Arrhenius's law in the temperature range, although multiple Arrhenius regions are needed to describe them. A slight decrease in the diffusion and permeability coefficients is observed with increasing pressure. However, this effect is not as significant as that of temperature and can be ignored when the pressure range is narrow enough. The ``hopping'' mechanism can be used to describe the diffusion of H2 in polyamide 6, where the continuous vibrations and ``hopping'' allow the diffusion of H2 molecules. These findings will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the permeation behavior of H2 in polyamide 6 and evaluate the gas barrier property of the material in practical applications.},

Compared with other types, the type IV hydrogen storage tank which consists of a polymer liner has the advantages of low cost, lightweight, and low storage energy consumption, but meanwhile, higher hydrogen permeability. A detailed review of the existing research on hydrogen permeability of the liner material of type IV hydrogen storage tanks can improve the understanding of the hydrogen permeation mechanism and provide references for following-up researchers and research on the safety of HFCVs. The process of hydrogen permeation and test methods are firstly discussed in detail. This paper then analyzes the factors that affect the process of hydrogen permeation and the barrier mechanism of the liner material and summarizes the prediction models of gas permeation. In addition to the above analysis and comments, future research on the permeability of the liner material of the type IV hydrogen storage tank is prospected.},

The diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in HNBR and EPDM are well correlated with the effective penetrant diameter except for CO               2               . CO               2               shows a lower diffusion coefficient due to its linear shape. Additionally, the favorable interaction between CO               2               and HNBR is another factor for its lower diffusion coefficient in HNBR. HNBR shows lower diffusion coefficients than EPDM. This is because the polar {\textendash}CN groups in HNBR chains increase interchain cohesion and result in tight intermolecular packing, low free volume and poor chain mobility, which decreases the diffusion coefficients of HNBR. The solubility coefficients of CH               4               , O               2               , N               2               and H               2               in HNBR are lower than those in EPDM, which is a result of the weak HNBR{\textendash}penetrant interactions and low free volume of HNBR. However, the solubility coefficient of CO               2               in HNBR is higher than in EPDM. This is attributed to the strong interaction between CO               2               and HNBR.

The proposed system enables data communication between Abaqus and DNN model, which leverages the versatile FE analysis ability of Abaqus and the powerful machine learning using DNN. Abaqus-DNN enables DNN to learn the constitutive law in a form-free manner. The learned result automatically satisfies the equilibrium and kinematics equations, which avoids inaccuracies associated with the presumed functions in the constitutive laws and guaranteed the learned constitutive law following the laws of physics. The Abaqus-DNN mechanics system was implemented to learn the full set of engineering constants of the constituents of a fiber-reinforced composite. Furthermore, the proposed system was applied to learn the progressive damage constitutive law of a fiber-reinforced composite laminate. The backward propagation equations of the neural network were modified to track the gradient of the loss function from Abaqus to DNN. The results show that Abaqus-DNN can accurately learn constitutive laws based on structural level data. This system provides a generalized approach for learning unknown physics inside a mechanics system by coupling neural network with commercial finite element codes.},

The composites are considered as the composites with 3D multi-directional braiding yarns as inclusions at the meso-scale, and the braiding yarns are viewed as unidirectional fibers reinforced composites at the micro-scale. The ETCs of the braiding yarns are firstly determined using the MFH method at the micro-scale. According to the yarn orientation, the composites are virtually decomposed into several pseudo-grains, each of which consists of the oriented braiding yarns and matrix, and the multi-step MFH method is then developed to predict the ETCs of the pseudo-grains and the composites sequentially at the meso-scale, i.e. the MFH prediction of the ETCs of each pseudo-grain individually and the composites consisting of all the pseudo-grains in two sequential steps. The proposed multi-scale and multi-step MFH method is validated by comparing with the multi-scale FE homogenization method and the available experimental test. The modeling results show that the through-thickness and in-plane ETCs of the composites increase with the increase of fiber volume fraction and transverse ETC, and decrease and increase with the increase of interior braiding angle, respectively. The proposed multi-scale and multi-step MFH method possesses the advantages of better computational efficiency and simpler implementation compared with the multi-scale FE homogenization method.},

Assuming a Lennard-Jones potential function for a molecule within its cage in the condensed phase, it can be shown that at small {$\Delta$}{\=v} considerable energy is required to redistribute the excess volume; however, at {$\Delta$}{\=v} considerably greater than some value {$\delta$}{\=v}g (corresponding to potentials within the linear region), most of the volume added can be redistributed freely. The transition from glass to liquid may be associated with the introduction of appreciable free volume into the system. Free volume will be distributed at random within the amorphous phase and there is a contribution to the entropy from this randomness which is not present in the entropy of the crystalline phase. According to our model all liquids would become glasses at sufficiently low temperature if crystallization did not intervene. Therefore whether or not a glass forms is determined by the crystallization kinetic constants and the cooling rate of the liquid. The experience on the glass formation is consistent with the generalization: at a given level of cohesive energy the glass-forming tendency of a substance in a particular class is greater the less is the ratio of the energy to the entropy of crystallization.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable energy carrier which plays a major role in the transition of the global energy market to a less fossil fuel dependent future. Polymer-based materials are crucial in the production, storage, transportation, and energy extraction of hydrogen. More insights in the hydrogen{\textendash}polymers interactions are required to guide material design and product development, especially for hydrogen solubility in polymers, which is crucial in many applications. The current study aims at rationalizing the determining factors of hydrogen solubility in two relevant polymers: polyamide-6 (PA-6) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). Based on atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data, we have reached several conclusions related to hydrogen and oxygen solubility in these two polymers. The crystal phases of PA-6 and HDPE are impenetrable to hydrogen and oxygen at elevated pressures, despite the small molecular size of hydrogen and oxygen. The practical implication for gas barrier applications is that polymer crystals act as impermeable obstacles and gas migration takes place primarily in the amorphous phase. Experimental hydrogen and oxygen solubilities in PA-6 and HDPE at elevated pressures can be predicted in a semiquantitative manner by molecular simulations. The discrepancies between experimental and predicted values could be attributed to neglect of the effect of crystal regions on the amorphous polymer domains. Although hydrogen is smaller than oxygen, it has been experimentally observed that hydrogen has a lower solubility in PA-6 and HDPE than oxygen. This observation has been confirmed by molecular simulations and attributed to the more favorable energetic interactions of oxygen with PA-6 and PE than of hydrogen. These interactions dominate the solubility behavior over the distribution of the accessible volume in the polymers.},

The traditional methods to study effective thermal conductivities of composite materials, such as the effective medium theory, the direct solution of heat diffusion equation, or the Boltzmann transport equation, are all based on developing good physical understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in those composite materials. In this work, we take a completely different approach to predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials using machine learning methods. With a set of trustable data, the support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and convolution neural network (CNN) are employed to train models that can predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials. We find that the models obtained from SVR, GPR, and CNN all have a better performance than the Maxwell-Eucken model and the Bruggeman model in terms of predicting accuracy. Our work demonstrates that machine learning methods are useful tools to fast predict the effective thermal conductivities of composite materials and porous media if the training data set is available. The machine learning approach also has the potential to be generalized and applied to study other physical properties of composite materials.},

  abstract = {This paper describes Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Spencer Composites Corporation (SCC) efforts in demonstrating an innovative approach to hydrogen delivery. This approach minimizes hydrogen delivery cost through utilization of glass fiber pressure vessels at 200~K and 70~MPa to produce a synergistic combination of container characteristics and properties of hydrogen gas: (1) hydrogen cooled to 200~K is {$\sim$}35\% more compact for a small increase in theoretical storage energy (exergy); and (2) these cold temperatures (200~K) strengthen glass fibers by as much as 50\%, expanding trailer capacity without the use of much more costly carbon fiber composite vessels. Analyses based on US Department of Energy H2A cost and efficiency parameters and economic methodology indicate the potential for hydrogen delivery costs below \$1/kg H2 (not including storage at the terminal, and cascade, compression, and chilling at the forecourt, but including compression and refrigeration at the terminal). Further savings are possible by integrating the delivery trailer into the station cascade to avoid chilling typically required for 700~bar hydrogen dispensing. The report also describes experimental work leading to demonstration of the potential for low cost delivery, starting with measurement of cold glass fiber strengthening, and continuing with subscale and full-scale pressure vessel development and testing, and concluding with successful development of an ASME X certifiable full-scale (60~cm diameter) glass fiber pressure vessel made of innovative materials with potential to meet the cost targets when integrated into an insulated tube trailer.},

  abstract = {The fundamentals in thermal-mass diffusion analogy are developed and the misunderstandings are clarified. The continuity of the ``wetness'' or, more appropriately, the ``fractional saturation'', w=C/Csat, is fundamentally proven using the equality principle of chemical potential. The validity of the analogy is independent of the linearity of the sorption isotherm. The mass diffusion equation with fractional saturation as the field variable is valid for source solute that is in either gaseous, liquid, or solid phase; and for absorbents that could be a combination of gaseous, liquid, and solid phases. Mass diffusion under complex conditions such as spatially non-uniform temperature and temporally varying source density/pressure can be readily modeled. However, discontinuity in fractional saturation could occur along the interface of two absorbents when diffusion occurs under a time-varying temperature condition. A novel technique {\textendash} the internal source technique {\textendash} has been developed that enables modeling of diffusion under such a condition using the standard thermal module in commercial finite element software.},

Conventionally, expensive and time-consuming experiments or simulations are required to evaluate polymer functions. Recently, Transformer models, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, have exhibited superior performance in natural language processing. However, such methods have not been investigated in polymer sciences. Herein, we report TransPolymer, a Transformer-based language model for polymer property prediction. Our proposed polymer tokenizer with chemical awareness enables learning representations from polymer sequences. Rigorous experiments on ten polymer property prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of TransPolymer. Moreover, we show that TransPolymer benefits from pretraining on large unlabeled dataset via Masked Language Modeling. Experimental results further manifest the important role of self-attention in modeling polymer sequences. We highlight this model as a promising computational tool for promoting rational polymer design and understanding structure-property relationships from a data science view.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the effects of hydrogen pressure, ambient temperature and pressure cycle pattern on fracture behavior of O-rings moulded from a peroxide-crosslinked EPDM rubber with white reinforcing filler under cyclic exposure to high-pressure hydrogen gas. By using a developed durability tester which enables the O-rings to expose cyclically high-pressure hydrogen gas, pressure cycle tests were performed at hydrogen pressures ranging from 10 to 70MPa and ambient temperatures ranging from 30 to 100{\textdegree}C under two pressure cycle patterns (test frequencies). The cyclic hydrogen exposure caused cracks in the O-rings, and their crack damage became more serious with an increase in the hydrogen pressure and the ambient temperature. The serious crack damage under high temperature is believed to be due to degradation of mechanical properties with increasing ambient temperature. At a hydrogen pressure of 10MPa, cracks (blisters) caused by bubbles formed from supersaturated hydrogen molecules after decompression were observed. At a hydrogen pressure of 35MPa or more, a large volume increase of the O-rings was observed by swelling; then, its volume increase induced extrusion fracture of the O-rings in addition to blister fracture. The crack damage also became more serious with a decrease in test frequency. The effect of the test frequency on the crack damage of the O-rings is presumed to be attributed to time-dependent crack growth behavior of the EPDM rubber.},

This implies that hydrogen penetrates into the composite as a hydrogen molecule. The addition of carbon black raised the hydrogen content of the composite, while the addition of silica did not. Based on observations, the blister damages of composites with silica were less pronounced, irrespective of the hydrogen pressures.

  abstract = {The work described in this study represents the first effort to model the complex phenomenon of plastic liner blistering during the depressurization of type IV hydrogen storage tanks. Blistering occurs because gas is absorbed by the plastic liner at high pressure and stresses are generated when the decompression rate exceeds the rate by which absorbed gas can escape by diffusion. It is important to eliminate blistering because type IV tanks are the lightest hydrogen storage option for GM and Honda's first generation of fuel cell vehicles. This report details the implementation of a simple polymer liner blistering model which is based on Henry's law, Fick's 2nd law, and a simple material yield criterion derived from continuum mechanics. Since the model agreed well with experiment, a parametric study was conducted to predict the onset of blistering as a function of liner thickness and depressurization rate. The model sets the basis for a predictive tool for the pre-selection of liner materials and designs. The pre-selection approach reduces the number of experiments that need to be conducted which potentially reduces the cost of hydrogen storage system development.},

An appropriate manufacturing process is important to improve the quality of polymer liners. In this paper, DSC, WAXD, a universal testing machine and a differential pressure gas permeameter were used to investigate the effect of the cooling rate of the rotational molding polyamide 11 on the thermal, crystallization, mechanical and barrier properties. The cooling rate is formulated according to the cooling rate that can be achieved in actual production. The results suggest that two PA11 liner materials initially exhibited two-dimensional (circular) growth under non-isothermal crystallization conditions and shifted to one-dimensional space growth due to spherulite collision and crowding during the secondary crystallization stage. The slower the cooling process, the greater the crystallinity of the specimen. The increase in crystallinity significantly improved the barrier properties of the two PA11 liner materials, and the gas permeability coefficient was 2-3-fold higher than at low crystallinity. Moreover, the tensile strength, the tensile modulus, the flexural strength, and the flexural modulus increased, and the elongation at break decreased as the crystallinity increased.},

The experimental results reveal that the increases in size of free volume holes and apparent free volume fraction are related to the increasing conversion of cure reaction. On the other hand, the mechanism of toughening (by adding the nano-clay to the thermosetting material) has been discussed by combining free volume and interfacial property. It is shown that, for the high crosslinking thermosetting material-based nanocomposites, both the property of free volume and dispersion state of nano-layers are the two key factors in determining toughening property. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, hydrogen leakage and delamination defects are prone to occur under cryogenic temperatures (CT) and high pressures. In the current work, polyethylene (PE) films were added to the interlayers of carbon fibers for blocking hydrogen permeation. After hot-pressing treatment, the films melted and wrapped the fibers to form a cross-linked network structure. Then, the resin impregnation and curing were conducted to obtain integrated composites with significant cryogenic mechanical and hydrogenbarrier properties. The results demonstrated that the cross-linked network structure resulted in a 22.7\% in\- crease in the cryogenic adhesion force. Under the toughening effects of PE, the longitudinal and transverse tensile strength increased by 23.2\% and 21.2\%, respectively, while maintaining high cryo-toughness. When 3 layers of PE films were added, the hydrogen permeability coefficients at room and cryogenic temperature were 1.0 {\texttimes} 10- 15 mol/(m{$\cdot$}s{$\cdot$}Pa) and 0.6 {\texttimes} 10- 15 mol/(m{$\cdot$}s{$\cdot$}Pa), respectively, which are lower than the international standard values. Numerous dense PE spherulites with irregular distribution were formed under the action of hot-pressing treatment, which generated tortuous paths within the composites to inhibit hydrogen permeation. The prepared composites may be useful in the manufacture of linerless type V CcH2 storage vessels.},

  abstract = {The van der Waals volume is a widely used descriptor in modeling physicochemical properties. However, the calculation of the van der Waals volume (V(vdW)) is rather time-consuming, from Bondi group contributions, for a large data set. A new method for calculating van der Waals volume has been developed, based on Bondi radii. The method, termed Atomic and Bond Contributions of van der Waals volume (VABC), is very simple and fast. The only information needed for calculating VABC is atomic contributions and the number of atoms, bonds, and rings. Then, the van der Waals volume (A(3)/molecule) can be calculated from the following formula: V(vdW) = summation operator all atom contributions - 5.92N(B) - 14.7R(A) - 3.8R(NR) (N(B) is the number of bonds, R(A) is the number of aromatic rings, and R(NA) is the number of nonaromatic rings). The number of bonds present (N(B)) can be simply calculated by N(B) = N - 1 + R(A) + R(NA) (where N is the total number of atoms). A simple Excel spread sheet has been made to calculate van der Waals volumes for a wide range of 677 organic compounds, including 237 drug compounds. The results show that the van der Waals volumes calculated from VABC are equivalent to the computer-calculated van der Waals volumes for organic compounds.},

The crystalline phase is successfully obtained by isothermal crystallisation for branch-free PE, while the existence of the branch hindered the formation of the crystalline phase in PE. In the amorphous phase, the density of end groups turns out to be a critical factor of H2 solubility. As the branch density increase the density of the end groups, the branch density, but not the branch length has a strong positive correlation with H2 solubility. While H2 is excluded from the crystalline phase and the majority of them dissolve within the amorphous region, H2 molecules were observed to dissolve in the crystalline-amorphous interface and directly neighbouring with the crystalline phase, with a preference for dissolving in the amorphous phase without being directly linked to crystalline phase via chemical bonds. Such behaviour could be explained by the rigidity of bonded crystalline-amorphous interface.},

  abstract = {Sealing structures of high-pressure hydrogen storage vessel are always considered as one of the significant components. This paper aims to study the sealing performance of the combined sealing structure composed of a rubber D-ring and a wedge-ring used in high-pressure hydrogen storage vessel by elucidating the swelling mechanisms due to dissolved hydrogen. Comparisons of the sealing performance between the D-ring and the O-ring are made in terms of the effects of some important factors including the wedge-ring, hydrogen pressure and swelling. Three aspects of conclusions are obtained by FEA: (1) The wedge-ring with a wedge angle 45{\textdegree} is the most suitable, compared with the angles 30{\textdegree} and 60{\textdegree}, irrespective of the shape of rubber rings. (2) The peak contact stress for the D-ring seal is larger than that for the O-ring seal under hydrogen pressure range 0{\textendash}100 MPa. (3) The O-ring seal could be replaced well by the D-ring seal, whereas the design height of the seal groove should be larger for the D-ring seal than for the O-ring seal due to swelling effect, in order to prevent the D-ring seal from extrusion through the upper side of the seal groove.},

  abstract = {Rubber O-ring seals have been extensively used in high-pressure hydrogen storage systems for preventing gas leakage. It is important for the design of rubber O-ring seals to clarify the sealing characteristics of the rubber O-ring under high-pressure gaseous hydrogen. In this paper, a finite element analysis model accounting for swelling due to dissolved hydrogen was developed to investigate the sealing performance of the combined seal structure constructed of a rubber O-ring and a wedge-ring under ultrahigh pressure gaseous hydrogen. The effects of wedge-ring, hydrogen pressure, and swelling on the sealing capacity of the combined seal were analyzed. Consequencely, it was found that the wedge-ring by itself can prevent the O-ring from extruding under ultrahigh pressure by filling up the clearance between the grooves, and the wedge-ring with the angle of 45{\textdegree}was the most suitable in comparison to those of 30{\textdegree}and 60{\textdegree}. The combined seal structure can enhance automatically the sealing capacity with increasing hydrogen pressure, and the increase of the peak contact stress was linearly proportional to that of the fluid pressure. In addition, the rising peak contact stress induced by swelling due to dissolved hydrogen could result in an improvement in sealing capacity, while the swelling may accelerate the mechanical damage of the O-ring owing to an increase in Mises stress.},

  abstract = {Predicting gas permeabilities of polymers a priori is a long-standing challenge within the membrane research community that has important applications for membrane process design and ultimately widespread adoption of membrane technology. From early attempts based on free volume and cohesive energy to more recent group contribution methods, the ability to predict membrane permeability has improved in terms of accuracy. However, these models usually stay ``within the paper'', i.e. limited model details are provided to the wider community such that adoption of these predictive platforms is limited. In this work, we combined an advanced polymer chemical structure fingerprinting method with a large experimental database of gas permeabilities to provide unprecedented prediction precision over a large range of polymer classes. No prior knowledge of the polymer is needed for the prediction other than the repeating unit chemical formula. In addition, we have incorporated this model into the existing Polymer Genome project to make it open to the membrane research community.},
